**Text Encryption Tool**

This web application allows you to encrypt and decrypt text securely using AES-CBC encryption. It utilizes PBKDF2 for key derivation from a passphrase and salt, ensuring robust security for your sensitive information.

**Features**

    Encryption: Encrypt plain text using AES-CBC encryption with a passphrase.
    Decryption: Decrypt encrypted text back to its original form using the same passphrase.
    Security: Implements PBKDF2 for key derivation and AES-CBC for encryption/decryption, ensuring data security.
    User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy text input and output.

**How to Use**

    Enter Passphrase: Provide a passphrase for encryption/decryption.
    Enter Text: Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
    Encrypt/Decrypt: Use the respective buttons to perform encryption or decryption.
    Output: The result will be displayed in the output textarea.
